## Before You Begin

### Required Items

To get started with your H7-Digital, you'll need:

- **H7-Digital flight controller** (what you just unboxed)
- **Frame/airframe** appropriate for your application
- **ESCs** compatible with your chosen firmware (DShot recommended)
- **Motors** and propellers matched to your frame
- **Battery** (3S-6S LiPo)
- **Radio transmitter and receiver** (ELRS, CRSF, SBUS, or PWM)
- **Digital VTX** (OpenIPC, DJI, Walksnail, or HDZero)
- **USB-C cable** for connecting to computer
- **Computer** running Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Optional but Recommended

- **GPS module** (required for ArduPilot autonomous flight)
- **Companion computer** (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, etc.)
- **MicroSD card** (for blackbox logging or firmware updates)
- **External compass** (if using GPS for autonomous flight)

## Quick Start Overview

Here's the high-level process to get flying:

1. **Unbox and inspect** your hardware
2. **Choose your firmware** (ArduPilot or Betaflight)
3. **Mount the flight controller** on your frame
4. **Connect peripherals** (ESCs, receiver, GPS, etc.)
5. **Install firmware** using appropriate tools
6. **Configure and calibrate** following firmware-specific guides
7. **Perform pre-flight checks** using the checklist
8. **Test flight** in safe environment

## Safety First

{: .warning }
> **Important Safety Information**
> 
> - Always remove propellers when testing on a bench
> - Never arm your aircraft with propellers installed indoors
> - Follow all local regulations and airspace restrictions
> - Complete all calibration procedures before first flight
> - Test in open area away from people and property

## Firmware Decision

Not sure which firmware to use? Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature | ArduPilot | Betaflight |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Best For** | Autonomous flight, waypoints | Manual FPV flight, racing |
| **GPS Required** | Yes (for auto modes) | No |
| **Companion Computer** | Excellent support (MAVLink) | Limited |
| **Tuning Complexity** | Moderate | Simple to advanced |
| **NDAA Compliance** | Yes (with secure firmware) | Standard builds |
| **Mission Planning** | Full support | Not applicable |
| **Acrobatic Flight** | Basic | Excellent |

See the [Choosing Firmware]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/choosing-firmware) page for a detailed comparison of ArduPilot vs Betaflight capabilities, use cases, and installation instructions.
