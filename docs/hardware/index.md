**Key Highlights:**
- **Processing**: 480MHz ARM Cortex-M7 with 1MB RAM, 2MB Flash
- **Sensors**: ICM-42688-P IMU (isolated power) + DPS368 barometer
- **Connectivity**: 6 UARTs (all with DMA), 2 I2C, USB-C, MicroSD
- **Power**: Dual BECs (5V/2A + 10V/2A software-controlled)
- **I/O**: 10 PWM outputs with bidirectional DShot support

## Design Philosophy

### Digital HD Only

The H7-Digital is designed exclusively for **modern digital HD video systems**. There is no analog video hardware on this board.

**Supported Systems**:
- OpenIPC
- DJI
- Walksnail/Avatar
- HDZero

This focus allows for:
- Modern, future-proof design
- Cleaner power delivery
- Reduced electromagnetic interference
- Reduced complexity and increased reliability
- Increased supply chain resilience (analog OSD implementation relies on outdated/EOL components)

### Companion Computer First

Unlike many flight controllers where companion computer support is an afterthought, the H7-Digital prioritizes companion computer integration:

- **Dedicated UART5** with DMA for high-bandwidth MAVLink
- **Optimized for Raspberry Pi and Jetson** platforms
- **Tested extensively** with common companion setups

### NDAA Compliance Ready

Hardware designed from the start for compliance:
- **Auditable supply chain**
- **US-based manufacturing**
- **No covered entities** in design or production
- **Secure firmware support** available

---

## Compliance

The H7-Digital hardware is designed and manufactured to meet:

- **NDAA Section 848** - Operating Software compliance ready
- **DIU Blue List Framework** - compliant (pending)
- **Made in USA** - Designed and manufactured domestically
